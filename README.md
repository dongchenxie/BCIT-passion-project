# BCIT-passion-project
## Description
This passion project is an upgrade of one of my previous projects. One of the website I have built and maintaining, [PG Chinese](https://www.pgchinese.net), was built on Google site. It is good but can be improved. Firstly, the styles from Google site are very limited. Secondly, the ways we can update the content are very limited as a well. So I decided to build a CMS base on Wordpress with customized theme and features.
